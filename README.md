# Eidolon_Clock
- This tool is a feature to see time in Eidolon land
## Version 
- I have built 2 version with different getting data method one use localtime (for only Asian area) and the other use API data (for all region).
- If you want to use API data please go to this [Language Code](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm) to find your region or nearest region version (Example: Eidolon_Clock_{your region code}).
## Bug
- It maybe have some different time from [Fandom Wiki](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/World_State) about 1 - 2 seconds but it still ok for me.
- If you catch a bug please feedback to me.
- Thank for read this project :)))
