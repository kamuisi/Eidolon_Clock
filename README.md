# Eidolon_Clock
- This tool is a feature to see time in Eidolon land. This tool maybe have some different time from [Fandom Wiki](https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/World_State) about 1 - 2 seconds but it still ok for me.
- For now this tool is just beta, maybe in the future i will add Baro Ki'Teer time in it.
- If you catch a bug please feedback with me.
- Thank for read this project :)))
